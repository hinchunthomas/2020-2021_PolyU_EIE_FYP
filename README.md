# 2020/2021 PolyU EIE Final Year Project

This repository contains the code and the sound sample for the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Transfer learning method is used in the model. The pre-trianed model we use is the VGGish, which is the trained by the database, called "AudioSet." It is a dataset of over 2 million human-labeled 10-second YouTube video soundtracks, with labels taken from an ontology of more than 600 audio event classes.

AudioSet was
[released](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/announcing-audioset-dataset-for-audio.html)
in March 2017 by Google's Sound Understanding team to provide a common
large-scale evaluation task for audio event detection as well as a starting
point for a comprehensive vocabulary of sound events.
